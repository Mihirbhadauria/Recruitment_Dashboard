# 📊 Recruitment_Dashboard

This project demonstrates my ability to design and deliver **real-world recruitment analytics** — from raw data through to clean visual insights. It was built as a showcase for potential clients looking to understand how their people data can drive smarter hiring and retention decisions.

## 🚀 Why I Built This

Recruitment and retention are two of the biggest levers in business performance — but too often, the data is scattered, manual, or hard to trust.

This project shows how I help clients:

- Turn raw HR data into clear, actionable dashboards
- Visualize hiring bottlenecks, turnover trends, and role-based insights
- Build scalable and user friendly data solutions using tools like **Power BI**, **Figma**, and **PowerQuery**

## 🔍 What It Covers

- **Recruitment KPIs**: time to hire, source of hire, role type, and retention outlook  
- **Internal Mobility**: employee transfers across departments  
- **Separation Analytics**: resignation vs termination vs retirement  
- **Role & Department Drilldowns**: filterable breakdowns of movement across the employee lifecycle

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Power BI** for dashboarding & DAX modeling
- **Power Query** for ingesting and transforming 
- **Figma** for layout design and prototyping  
- **Excel** for accessible data formatting
